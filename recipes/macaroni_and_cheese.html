    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Quick, easy, and tasty macaroni and cheese dish. Fancy, designer mac and
      cheese often costs forty or fifty dollars to prepare when you have so many
      expensive cheeses, but they aren't always the best tasting. This simple
      recipe is cheap and tasty.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni</li>
      <li>¼ cup butter</li>
      <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 cups milk</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni until al dente,
        about 8 minutes.

        <strong>Tip:</strong>For a thicker mac and cheese, double the amount of
        macaroni.

        While the macaroni is cooking, go ahead and start on the roux. A roux is
        a thickening agent made of one part fat and one part flour that makes up
        the base of this creamy mac and cheese. To make the roux, start by
        melting butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour, salt, and
        pepper and stir until smooth. Slowly pour in milk and stir until the
        mixture is smooth and bubbling. Be careful to not let the milk burn.

        Finally, the most crucial step: Add cheese! Slowly stir in Cheddar
        cheese until smooth and melted. We recommend you grate your own cheese
        because pre-shredded cheese won't incorporate into the mixture as well
        as block cheese. Once the macaroni is finished cooking, drain and stir
        into cheese sauce until coated.
